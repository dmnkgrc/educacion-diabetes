In people with diabetes, this leads to an increase in blood glucose. The Dusk phenomenon occurs later in the day, usually before dinner. High BG values in the afternoon are caused by insufficient basal insulin. The result is that the body needs more insulin to achieve the same effect during these times of the day. The insulin pump system allows you and your healthcare team to make basal rate adjustments to counteract this phenomenon.</p></div>

When we talk about the &quot;infusion set&quot; we are normally referring to the 2 major components of the set = 1 / A head set that houses the cannula and 2 / A transfer set with the tubing / line. The cannula is made of either Teflon<sup>®</sup> (soft cannula) or stainless steel (steel cannula). A soft cannula is inserted with an introducer needle which is then removed once the cannula is in place. A steel cannula does not require an extra introducer needle for insertion. The infusion set is used together with a protective cap/ protective cover for situations when the pump is disconnected from the body, e.g. showering, playing contact sports, scuba diving etc. Depending on the type of infusion set, the cannula can be inserted at a variable angle or at 90 degrees. Soft cannulas are normally changed every 2-3 days and steel cannulas every 1-2 days. Depending on manufacturers recommendation; tubing or line is generally changed with every cartridge or at least every 6 days.</p></div>

This function is helpful in matching your changing insulin needs due to increased or decreased activity level, illness or stress. Your basal rate is regarded as 100%. You can, however, increase the basal rate to as high as 250% or to as low as 0% for up to 24 hours. When you increase or decrease your basal rate, each hourly rate for the duration you program is increased or decreased.</p></div>
